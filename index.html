      <h1>Global Warming</h1>
      <h2>Global warming, also referred to as climate change.</h2>

      <p id="frst-p">
        <span class="beginning"> <strong>The planet is warming</strong></span>, from North Pole to South Pole. Since 1906, the global average surface temperature has increased between 1.1 and 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius)–even more in sensitive polar regions. And the effects of rising temperatures aren’t waiting for some far-flung future–signs of the effects of global warming are appearing right now. The heat is melting glaciers and sea ice, shifting precipitation patterns, and setting animals on the move.

      <h3>Facts About Climate Change:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Global warming is the increase of Earth's average surface temperature.</li>
        <li>Global warming is happening largely due to an over-emittance of these gases and fossil fuels (natural oil, gasoline, coal).</li>
        <li>With the start of industry in the 1700's, humans began emitting more fossil fuels from coal, oil, and gas to run our cars, trucks, and factories.</li>
        <li>There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than at any point in the last 800,000 years.</li>
        <li>Though Americans make up just 4 percent of the world's population, we produce 25 percent of the carbon dioxide pollution from fossil-fuel burning -- by far the largest share of any country.</li>
        <li>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has both the authority and responsibility to reduce pollution from electric power plants under the Clean Air Act, the nation's bedrock air pollution law adopted in 1970.</li>
        <li>Since 1870, global sea levels have risen by about 8 inches.</li>
        <li>Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.</li>
      </ol>

       <strong>What is the Paris Agreement?</strong> In 2015, almost every country in the world -- 195 countries in total -- agreed to the Paris Agreement, the first global pact to combat climate change by setting goals to reduce their country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Obama Administration, the US pledged to cut its carbon pollution by 26-28% by 2025.

    <h4>The Impact of Climate Change on Natural Disasters</h4>
    <p>
     Climate change may not be responsible for the recent skyrocketing cost of natural disasters, but it is very likely that it will impact future catastrophes. Climate models provide a glimpse of the future, and while they do not agree on all of the details, most models predict a few general trends. First, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will probably boost temperatures over most land surfaces, though the exact change will vary regionally. More uncertain—but possible—outcomes of an increase in global temperatures include increased risk of drought and increased intensity of storms, including tropical cyclones with higher wind speeds, a wetter Asian monsoon, and, possibly, more intense mid-latitude storms.
